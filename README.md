# Data Science - Decision Tree

## In this assignment, you will build a Decision-Tree Classifier to predict the species of Iris Flowers. You will build two models, one with gini index criterion and another one with entropy criterion. First you will split your data into training and test sets. For this step you can use %75 of your data for training and the remaining %25 for testing. Do not forget to first randomize your data!

## Train a Decision-Tree Classifier with Gini index. Use Graphviz library to visualize your Decision Tree.Then use the model you have trained to predict the species of each flower in the test set. Create a confusion matrix for your predictions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) Report the accuracy, precision, recall (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) and f-1 score(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) of your model on your test set. Discuss whether your model is overfitting or not. Please explain how you decide this in your comments.

## Then, train a a Decision-Tree Classifier with entropy criterion. Use Graphviz library to visualize your Decision Tree. Afterwards, use the model you have trained to predict the species of each flower in the test set. Create a confusion matrix for your predictions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) Report the accuracy, precision, recall(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) and f-1score (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fscore) of your model on your test set. Discuss whether your model is overfitting or not. Please explain how you decide this in your comments.

## For this assignment, you are allowed to use scikit-learn library’s built in functions to create Decision Trees. For visualization purposes, you can use Graphviz library. As usual, you can also use other fundamental libraries we use in class (matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas).
